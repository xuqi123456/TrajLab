## TrajLab-application module

It mainly involves three modules: trajectory heatmap, trajectory clustering, and trajectory geofencing. Mainly focusing on trajectory RDD abstraction to implement upper level applications

## TrajLab-base module

Mainly involving trajectory object modeling and logical definition, involving trajectory related elements such as trajectory objects, bounding boxes, and some spatial processing tools

## TrajLab-core

It mainly involves the access and output of trajectory data, as well as the conversion of different spatial data formats to trajectory data processing platforms

## TrajLab-db

A logical storage model involving trajectory objects

## TrajLab-query

Involving multi-dimensional spatiotemporal retrieval with trajectory objects as the core, including analytical high-order retrieval functions
